# SIMPLE GIN APP
This is a [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) app developed in [Go](https://go.dev) using the [Gin framework](https://gin-gonic.com/).

The idea is to build a [CRUD app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) that also integrates a [RESTful API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/?nc1=h_ls) allowing the data to be used independently, thus enabling CRUD operations from a client app (whether or not a client app is going to be made -and the language/frameworks for it- remains undecided at this point).

**Note:** This is a work in progress.
